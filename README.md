# Seque

Seque is a polyphonic, 8 channel sequencer profile for the Grid EN16 MIDI controller from Intech Studio. Uses multiple counters/timers triggered by a global timer in the system events to send up to 8 MIDI notes at independent intervals. 

Each channel can be individually set to trigger on a range from 1 (every beat) to 64 (every 64th beat), allowing the creation of complex polyrhythms and euclidean-like sequences. The random sequence generator cycles through new patterns at user-controlled intervals to provide exploration of rhythms from predictable to chaotic.

MIDI notes can be set manually or using the scale / mode function. The tranpose function can shift the root note of your pattern.

Also features global start/stop and tempo control.

## Updates

### v1.3
- Builds on the rework by intechstudio which brought enhanced performance and profile size, especially for older modules.
- Button 13 now transposes current scale to selected root note, instead of setting all notes to unison.
- LED 13 set to high when new note selected but not yet set.
- Minor tweaks to timings and divisions.

## Installation

~Just drop the included json file in your user folder (../grid-userdata/profiles/user) and load it onto your EN16 module in the Grid Editor.~

Updated for Grid Profile Cloud. Grab it from the Profile Cloud in Grid Editor or via the link: grid-editor://?config-link=V67kSzIxCPu7xmDfVS1g

## Usage

### Encoders 0 â€” 7 (Top Two Rows): Individual Step Controllers

- Rotate Left / Right
  - Increase / Decrease note repetition frequency. This is done by adjusting the counter between `midi_send` commands.
- Button
  - Toggle on / off `midi_send`. Does not stop the counter.
- LED
  - Red == 'off'.
  - Blue (encoders 0 â€” 3) or purple (encoders 4 â€” 7) == 'on'.
  - Flash indicates start of counter (and note send if on).

### Encoders 8 â€” 11 (Third Row): Individual Pitch Adjustments

- Rotate Left / Right
  - Decrease / Increase pitch of MIDI note for encoders 0 â€” 3 respectively.
- Push & Rotate Left / Right
  - Decrease / Increase pitch of MIDI note for encoders 4 â€” 7 respectively.
- LED
  - Blue == Controlling pitch of encoder two rows above.
  - Purple == Controlling pitch of encoder one row above.

### Encoder 12 (Bottom Left): Scale / Mode Selector

- Rotate Left / Right
  - Move through the Mode selector. Current options are:
    1. Ionian (I) ðŸ”´
    2. Dorian (ii) ðŸŸ 
    3. Phrygian (iii) ðŸŸ¡
    4. Lydian (IV) ðŸŸ¢
    5. Mixolydian (V) ðŸ”µ
    6. Aeolian (iv) ðŸŸ£
    7. Locrian (viiÃ¸) ðŸŸ£
- Button
  - Apply selected scale to all note steps. Applies the scale from root (encoder 0) to octave (encoder 7).
  - Is based on current Root Note (Encoder 13).
- LED
  - Displays mode options (see colours above).

### Encoder 13: Root Note Selector

- Rotate Left / Right
  - Select root note of scale.
  - Default is currently C3
- Button
  - Transpose current scale or step notes to new root note (encoder 0 is always considered the root).
- LED
  - High LED indicates new root not selected but not yet applied.   

### Encoder 14 : Random Rhythm Generator

- Rotate Left / Right
  - Increase / Decrease speed of new random step / note frequency set.
- Button
  - Toggle On / Off.
  - Off by default.
  - When on, random step count with be applied to all 8 sequencer encoders.
  - Will keep generating new random sequences until turned off.
- LED
  - Random colour as visual indicator for new sequence generator

### Encoder 15 (Bottom Right): Global Start / Stop & Tempo Control

- Rotate Left / Right
  - Increase / Decrease global tempo.
- Button
  - Toggle Start / Stop of sequencer.
  - Resets counter to zero but does not clear current steps and / or note pitches.
- LED
  - Tempo Indicator
